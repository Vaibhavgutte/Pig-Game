# Pig-Game


**Description:**
The Pig Game is a classic dice game that combines luck and strategy. It can be played by two or more players and is a great way to have fun and test your decision-making skills.

**Objective:**
The goal of the Pig Game is to be the first player to reach a predetermined target score, often set at 100 points.

**How to Play:**
- Players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die.
- On your turn, you can roll the die as many times as you want to accumulate points. Each roll's value is added to your current turn's score.
- Be cautious! If you roll a 1, you lose all the points you've earned during your turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- To secure the points you've accumulated during your turn, you can choose to "hold." When you hold, your turn ends, and the points are added to your overall score.
- The game continues with each player taking turns, rolling the die, and deciding when to hold.
- The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

**Special Rules:**
- Rolling a 1 on your first roll ends your turn, and you score no points for that turn.
- Some variations of the Pig Game may have additional rules or variations, such as requiring a player to score exactly 100 points to win.

**Strategy:**
The Pig Game involves a balance of risk and reward. Players must decide whether to keep rolling for more points or play it safe by holding. Knowing when to take risks and when to hold is the key to success in this game.
